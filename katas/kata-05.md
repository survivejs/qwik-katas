# Qwik Kata 5 - Routing

The purpose of this kata is to understand how Qwik City routing works and how to define your own routes within the application. The kata assumes you have already completed [kata 4](kata-04.md).

## Learning aims

The idea here is to understand the following:

* Creating new routes
* Leveraging nested layouts
* Adding breadcrumbs
* Authoring with mdx

## Task

Complete the following:

1. Create a new route to show all collections at once (i.e., `/inventories`)
2. Extract a `useLoadInventory` helper from the new route
3. Allow accessing individual collections using a specific url (i.e., `/inventories/home`)
4. Optional - Show the available pages as breadcrumbs at the site footer
5. Optional - Set up a `/blog` and author a page using mdx about your collection management system
6. Optional - Include a sample inventory to the mdx content of the page you just added to demonstrate the system
