# Qwik Kata 1 - Getting started

The purpose of this kata is to get your feet wet with Qwik and get the environment running on your system so don't expect too much yet.

During the following katas, we'll build a small application for home inventory management. You don't have to be strict with naming and you can be creative as the overall concepts will remain the same. Essentially we'll be building up a small user interface and a related backend as we complete the tasks.

## Learning aims

The idea here is to get a Qwik application running and cover the following:

* Bootstrapping a Qwik application
* Creating a Qwik component
* Rendering multiple Qwik components
* Importing Qwik components
* `props` in Qwik

## Task

Complete the following:

1. Bootstrap a Qwik application (hint: you can [find the command at Qwik website](https://qwik.builder.io/))
2. Run the application locally (hint: `npm run` is useful)
3. Find and modify an existing component while the development server is running
4. Create a new component called `Inventory` and render a mock text (say "inventory goes here") through it
5. Render the new `Inventory` component through the application
6. Render the `Inventory` component twice
7. Parametrize the `Inventory` component so that you can pass a `title` string to it and render the passed string instead of the mock text
8. Render another `Inventory` component with a different `title`
