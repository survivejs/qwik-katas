# Qwik Kata 4 - Styling

The purpose of this kata is to show how to style your Qwik application. The kata assumes you have already completed [kata 3](kata-03.md).

## Learning aims

The idea here is to learn the following:

* How to use scoped styles
* How to integrate Tailwind
* How to use styled-vanilla-extract
* Understand why many of the css-in-js solutions are not a good fit for Qwik and why these are
* Understand the differences between the approaches

## Task

Complete the following:

1. Style the `Inventory` component using scoped styles. Hint: Look up `useStylesScoped$`.
2. Style the `Inventory` component using [Tailwind](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/integrations/tailwind/)
3. Optional - Style the `Inventory` component using [styled-vanilla-extract](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/integrations/styled-vanilla-extract/)
