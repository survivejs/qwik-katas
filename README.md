# qwik-katas - Learn Qwik Quickly

[Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/) is what we might call a disappearing web framework. The design aim of the framework is to ship as little JavaScript code as efficiently as possible. In other words, JavaScript should not be loaded unless it is strictly needed. That said, you as a developer have some amount of control over the process. For those that know frameworks like React, Qwik is doing **code splitting** out of the box in a granular manner and you don't have to worry about it. [Qwik City](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/overview/) ("Next.js" of Qwik) provides nice and simple ways to interact with a backend though a rpc-style interface not to mention many other features.

The repository contains [katas](katas/) and [solutions](solutions/). Each kata comes with a brief description for learning aims, background information, and a task to perform. The katas have been designed to form a continuum so make sure to start from the first one and complete them in a successive manner. Each kata is fairly simple and the goal is to teach a concept per kata to avoid overwhelming anyone.

## Katas

1. [Getting started](katas/kata-01.md) - [Solution](solutions/kata-01)
2. [State management](katas/kata-02.md) - [Solution](solutions/kata-02)
3. [Actions and loaders](katas/kata-03.md) - [Solution](solutions/kata-03)
4. [Styling](katas/kata-04.md) - [Solution](solutions/kata-04)
6. [Routing](katas/kata-05.md) - [Solution](solutions/kata-05)

## Prerequisites

To be able to complete the katas, you need the following:

* Adequate command of JavaScript and TypeScript programming languages
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Optional but it is a good idea to version your work so you can see what was done and why
