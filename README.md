# qwik-katas - Learn Qwik Quickly

[Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/) is what we might call a disappearing web framework. The design aim of the framework is to ship as little JavaScript code as efficiently as possible. In other words, JavaScript should not be loaded unless it is strictly needed. That said, you as a developer have some amount of control over the process. For those that know frameworks like React, Qwik is doing **code splitting** out of the box in a granular manner and you don't have to worry about it. [Qwik City](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/overview/) ("Next.js" of Qwik) provides nice and simple ways to interact with a backend though a rpc-style interface not to mention many other features.

These Qwik katas have been adapted from [red-gate/web-kata](https://github.com/red-gate/web-kata) and they have been planned with kata type of workshops in mind. Ideally you would work with a pair but you can complete these alone as well. The point is to get used to the related tooling and the ideas behind Qwik so that you are comfortable building something yourself with it.

The repository contains `katas` and `solutions`. Each kata comes with a brief description for learning aims, background information, and a task to perform. The katas have been designed to form a continuum so make sure to start from the first one and complete them in a successive manner. Each kata is fairly simple and the goal is to teach a concept per kata to avoid overwhelming anyone.

## Katas

1. [Kata 1 - Introduction to Qwik](katas/kata-01.md) - [Solution](solutions/kata-01)
2. [Kata 2 - Add and remove objects](katas/kata-02.md) - [Solution](solutions/kata-02)
3. [Kata 3 - Filter, show and hide objects](katas/kata-03.md) - [Solution](solutions/kata-03)
4. [Kata 4 - Add router to an app](katas/kata-04.md) - [Solution](solutions/kata-04)
5. [Kata 5 - Interaction with backend server through REST API calls](katas/kata-05.md) - [Solution](solutions/kata-05)

## Prerequisites

To be able to complete the katas, you need the following:

* Adequate command of JavaScript and TypeScript programming languages
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Optional but it is a good idea to version your work so you can see what was done and why
